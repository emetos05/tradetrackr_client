# Next.js + Tailwind Development Instructions

Instructions for high-quality Next.js applications with Tailwind CSS styling and TypeScript.

## Project Context

- Latest Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Development Standards

### Architecture

- App Router with server and client components
- Group routes by feature/domain
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use React Server Components by default
- Leverage static optimization where possible

### TypeScript

- Strict mode enabled
- Clear type definitions
- Proper error handling with type guards
- Zod for runtime type validation

### Styling

- Tailwind CSS with consistent color palette
- Responsive design patterns
- Dark mode support
- Follow container queries best practices
- Maintain semantic HTML structure
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Use a mobile-first approach.

### State Management

- React Server Components for server state
- React hooks for client state
- Proper loading and error states
- Optimistic updates where appropriate

### Data Fetching

- Server Components for direct database queries
- React Suspense for loading states
- Proper error handling and retry logic
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Use Supabase SDK for data fetching and querying.
- For data model creation, use Supabase's schema builder.

### Security

- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper authentication checks
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting implementation
- Secure API route handling

### Performance

- Image optimization with next/image
- Font optimization with next/font
- Route prefetching
- Proper code splitting
- Bundle size optimization

### Vercel AI SDK Integration

- Use Vercel AI SDK for building AI-powered features.
- Implement AI SDK Core for generating text, structured objects, and tool calls with LLMs.
- Utilize AI SDK UI hooks for building chat interfaces.
- Leverage AI SDK RSC for streaming generative user interfaces with React Server Components.

## Implementation Process

1. Plan component hierarchy
2. Define types and interfaces
3. Implement server-side logic
4. Build client components
5. Add proper error handling
6. Implement responsive styling
7. Add loading states
8. Write tests
